not gonna talk about busses

we create a Surface which contains a series of nodes, in this case one
we then pass our compiled shader to the node


now we can pass props



now we can animate

Backbuffer is the last buffer

https://webglfundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-shaders-and-glsl.html

only floats

bit like regex, find a cool shader and drop it in

User interaction with heart


    // Step will return 0.0 unless the value is over 0.5,
    // in that case it will return 1.0
    float y = step(0.5,st.x);

        // Mix uses pct (a value from 0-1) to
        // mix the two colors
        color = mix(colorA, colorB, pct);
